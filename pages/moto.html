			<h1>I love motorcycles and motorcycling!!!</h1>
			<p>I love motorcycles and motorcycling <i>so much</i> that I spent 45 minutes just trying to match the background color of this page to the color of my first motorcycle: a 1984 Honda Magna 750 (pictured below).</p>
			<br />
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Magna" target="blank"><img src="../photos/moto_magna.jpg"></a>

			<h2>I have owned a number of motorcycles over the years, and this page is dedicated to them.</h2>
		</div>

		<div id="magna">
			<p>As mentioned above, the 1984 Honda Magna was my first bike. Not only was it my first bike, but it was also the first bike I ever rode. It was 1997, and my older brother - and his girlfriend at the time - both rode. My brother, after a 30 second course on how motorcycles worked (it was literlly him describing where the front brake, back brake, clutch, and accelerator were... and that was it!), invited me to jump on his Magna, while he rode his girlfriend's bike, and we were off.</p>
			<p>With no instructions on how to turn, how hard to brake, how strongly to accelerate, I was basically on my own to figure out all the basics. And honestly, it's a fucking miracle I didn't die... Which brings me to...</p>

			<p>Above you'll see a photo of my second bike: a 1997 Yamaha FZR600. This was a street bike I had no business owning, seeing as I was 22, and really, really, stupid still. I bought it off a guy who was in the military, and was moving to Europe in a few days, so he was motivated to sell, and I got it for cheap.</p>
			<p>This bike had a water-cooled, 600cc, 4-cylinder engine that cranked out <i><b>way</b></i> more power than any dumdum 22 year old needed. I think the top speed I got it up to on the highway was 130mph? 135 maybe?</p>
			<p>Stupid.</p>
			<p>Stupid.</p>
			<p>Stupid. ... But exciting.</p>
			<p>Which brings me to...</p>

			<h3 class="moto">Motorcycling Tip #2:</h3>
			<h4 class="moto">For the love of Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad, Michael Cera, or whoever you pray to: ATGATT! ALL THE GEAR, ALL THE TIME!!!</h4>

			<p>Granted, you go down at 135mph, and you're pretty much dead no matter what. But most accidents happen under 40 mph, and usually at night. Wear your gear, and be flashy! I have a bright pink vest I wear pretty everywhere. Do people think I look cool? No. Do people see me? Yuuup.</p>

			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Boulevard_S40" target="blank"><img src="../photos/moto_s40.jpg"></a>
			<p>Next we have my least favorite, least powerful, slowest, saddest motorcyle: the 2004 Suzuki Boulevard S40. Yuck. What a piece of shit. To be fair, it was a fine bike, and did exactly what it was made to do: get around a 130lb person from point "a" to point "b" slowly and boringly.</p>
			<p>I mean, it wasn't designed to be big and fast and fun. It was a cheap bike that I could afford, with low mileage. I think I picked it up for a grand, and then sold it 3 years later for $1200. My wife and I were both in grad school at the time, and money was tight; so I bought a cheap-ass <abbr title="Piece of Shit">POS</abbr> bike.</p>
			<p>And now for...</p>

			<h3 class="moto">Motorcycling Tip #3:</h3>
			<h4 class="moto">If you don't want to be sad on your bike all damn day, buy one that's big enough for you, and that you'll have room to "grow into."</h4>

			<p>The fact of the matter is that motorcycling is like anything else with a steep learing curve: at first, everything is confusing, new, and maybe a bit scary. But then after a bit of time, you learn the ropes, and you thirst for more. At some point your thirst become bigger than your source, and you want something bigger, faster, better, etc. You can take it easy with a big bike when you begin, but you can't go big with a small bike when you feel ready. You're simply delimited by the bike itself. Find a bike you like, and feel comfortable on, then go with one a bit bigger. Just don't do what I did with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_FZR600">FZR600</a> and go like, <i><b>8 sizes</b></i> too big!</p>

			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Bolt" target="blank"><img src="../photos/moto_bolt.jpg"></a>
			<p>And last, but very much not least, my current (and my favorite) motorcycle: the 2014 Yamaha Bolt R-Spec.</p>
			<p>Now, try not to tear-up (because I'm going to) as I tell you about this beautiful machine. I had been without a bike for about 18 months - and trust me, 18 months for someone who has "the bike-bug" is a loooong-ass time! Anywho, I'd been dreaming of riding for over a year, and grad school was over, we had both graduated, found great jobs in our professions, and started making adult money.</p>
			<p>Now, keep in mind, I have never <i><b>in my life</b></i> owned something new; I mean, other than my sox and underwear. My family was pretty low-income growing up, therefore a number of ideas about money, and how to spend it (or how <b>not</b> to spend it) were ingrained in me from early childhood.</p>
			<p>Needless to stay, despite what my family of origin taught me, I decided to splurge for once in my life, and buy something new. And not just any something, a something I had been pining for for <i>years</i>.</p>
			<p>Enter the above bike. And *deep exhale* let me tell you. I fucking love this bike! 950cc, air-cooled, 4-stroke, 4-valve SOHC V-twin thumper that bangs out excellent power and crispy low-end torque.</p>
			<p>It rides like a dream, performs like a champion, and I have loved every second of time, and every mile ridden (~12,000) on it so far.</p>
			<p>And now my final tip...</p>
